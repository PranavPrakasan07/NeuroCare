# Description
- The current global pandemic has not only affected people's physical health but also their mental health.

- Some people have lost their jobs, and some have lost their loved ones.

- So having someone who can hear you out without judgment and give you the best advice, will be very beneficial.

- We plan to make a free e-psychology platform that will allow a person to book anonymous appointments with certified counselors who shall help them out with their woes. Our platform shall have a chat-bot that will use sentimental analysis to understand a person's mental state by asking relevant questions and thus allowing the counselors to help them better. 

- The platform shall also post periodically useful information like symptoms of stress, how to deal with stress, and healthy lifestyles for a better mental and physical state of the body.

- This platform will be highly effective as it will be convenient for both the counselors and the users in this time of the pandemic and even later.
